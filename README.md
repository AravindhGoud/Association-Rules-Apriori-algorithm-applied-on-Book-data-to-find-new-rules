# Association-Rules-Apriori-algorithm-applied-on-Book-data-to-find-new-rules
Association Rules algorithm used to understand new rules and patterns on retail Book data
1) Interpreted data with different values of support and confidence. Observed the change in number of rules for different support,confidence values
2) Changed the minimum length in apriori algorithm
3) Visulization of rules using different plots
